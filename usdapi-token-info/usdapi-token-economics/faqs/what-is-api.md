# What is API?

API is the abbreviation for “application programming interface” — an API is the connection between disparate web servers, applications, or databases on the internet.

APIs permeate throughout Web2, with Google universal log-in, Plaid and Stripe’s credit card and bank account integrations, Facebook’s advertising marketplace, and Twilio’s real-time text services acting as some of the most utilized features of the modern internet.

APIs allow developers to offer third-party services or information in their applications, using only the API’s code itself, not needing to worry about the operation of additional services or the maintenance of additional databases. In doing so, APIs significantly speed up the development of cloud-based technologies, helping businesses provide optimized customer experiences at a much faster rate.
