# What is the API token?

The API Token is the native token of The APIS protocol, deriving its utility from:

* Staking by APIS Nodes and APIS Gateways: Nodes and gateway operators are required to stake a number of API tokens in order to establish their network presence. This will be subject to slashing, should the actor be proven to act maliciously;
* Dispute resolution: This mechanism allows API holders to determine whether Nodes or Gateways acted maliciously (similar to Augurâ€™s dispute resolution mechanism);
* Staking by Optimistic or Zk-Rollup validators: We anticipate this feature will be in place within a year, and;
* Governance: Numerous ways to decide on new APIS contracts and upgrades through a voting system.
