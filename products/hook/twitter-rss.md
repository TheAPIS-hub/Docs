## What is an RSS feed?&#x20;

It’s a technology that has influenced many modern internet tools you’re familiar with, and its streamlined, algorithm-free format could make it your following great tool for reading what you want online.

RSS stands for “straightforward syndication” or, depending on who you ask, “rich site summary.” At its heart, RSS refers to simple text files with necessary, updated information — news pieces, articles, that sort of thing. That stripped-down content gets plugged into a feed reader, an interface that quickly converts the RSS text files into a stream of the latest updates from around the web.

As internet content became more complex, RSS files quickly adopted images, video, and more, but still in a stripped-down format for more effortless loading and compatibility across all feed readers. Readers usually automatically update to deliver the newest content right to your device. This approach allows internet users to create their online feeds filled with custom updates from the sites they regularly visit.

This tool does grant a unique and **easy-to-use method of building an email list** and **sharing the latest and most popular Twitter content** with our community. To use this function, you only need to <mark style="background-color:purple;">enter the email address</mark> where you’d like to receive these newsletters.

Simply by entering the term or topic, you're interested in into the search box on the Explore interface, you can easily get the relevant tweets. It also saves you time by reducing aimless information gathering.
