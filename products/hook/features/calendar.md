Click Add New Project, type in some basic information about the NFT project you want to track and set the mint date.&#x20;

MintNumber stands for the number of NFT you can mint per wallet or whitelist spot. TotalSupply represents the max supply available to mint for this project. Another very important feature is our time zone conversion feature, which means that entering the time of different time zones can be automatically converted into your local time countdown.
