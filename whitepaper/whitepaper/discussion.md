# 4⃣ Discussion

In this paper, we have presented a scalable, decentralized protocol for the indexing and querying of datasets inherent to public blockchains. The protocol is based on knowledge of REST and GraphQL message formatting and optimization, consequently ensuring that developers can obtain data from Ethereum, Filecoin, and all other relevant blockchains with uptime guarantees, hyper-competitive market pricing, and in formats that mainstream developers have vast experience integrating with already. The protocol is composed of two groups: Gateways and Nodes, although a Gateway can be a Node and vice-versa. The purpose of the dual infrastructure is to allow developers to select receive endpoints as quickly as possible, while ensuring that both the providers of endpoints are incentivized to act in the best interest of the APIS Network. The APIS Network is community governed, with governance primarily focused on the Dispute Resolution Contract, which has been influenced by the Augur project’s approach to subjective oracle design, and the Optimistic Rollup Contract, which has been influenced by the work of Optimism. Lastly, to encourage maximal community ownership and corresponding decentralization, users of APIS will receive API tokens proportionate to their usage, with a system designed to mitigate wash-trading and encouraging further decentralization of Nodes and Gateways. The remaining of the paper is dedicated to an analysis and overview of REST and GraphQL APIs, namely how each standard functions and the tradeoffs therein.
